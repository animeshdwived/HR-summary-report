# HR Summary Report Dashboard (Power BI)
## Project object
The objective of this project is to design an interactive HR Summary Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize key HR metrics such as employee distribution, salary analysis, satisfaction levels, and employment status. The dashboard aims to provide HR managers and decision-makers with clear, data-driven insights that support strategic workforce planning, improve employee engagement, and identify areas requiring attention such as high turnover roles or gender pay gaps.
