# HR Summary Report Dashboard (PowerÂ BI)
## Project object
The objective of this project is to design an interactive HR Summary Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize key HR metrics such as employee distribution, salary analysis, satisfaction levels, and employment status. The dashboard aims to provide HR managers and decision-makers with clear, data-driven insights that support strategic workforce planning, improve employee engagement, and identify areas requiring attention such as high turnover roles or genderÂ payÂ gaps.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/animeshdwived/HR-summary-report/blob/main/HRData.csv">Dataset</a>

# Questions (KPIs)
- How many employees are currently working in the organization?
- What is the total salary expenditure?
- How many employees distributed across different departments?
- What are the employment status types and how many fall under each?
- How satisfied are the employees?
- What are the salary distribution across different job positions?
- Which departments or positions have the highest number of terminated employees?
- What is the gender distribution of the workforce?
- Which positions contribute most to the salary budget?

  # Process
1.	ðŸ“¥ Data Collection
	â€¢	Collected raw HR data including employee details, salaries, satisfaction scores, departments, genders, and employment statuses.
	â€¢	Data was provided in Excel/CSV format.
	2.	ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preparation
	â€¢	Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
	â€¢	Standardized categorical values (e.g., job roles, departments).
	â€¢	Created calculated columns and measures (e.g., total salary, satisfaction buckets).
	3.	ðŸ”— Data Modeling
	â€¢	Defined relationships between tables (e.g., Employees, Positions, Departments).
	â€¢	Built a star schema where required to optimize performance.
	â€¢	Used DAX to create measures like Total Salary, Employee Count, and Average Satisfaction.
	4.	Dashboard Development
	â€¢	Built an interactive Power BI dashboard using:
	â€¢	KPI cards for key metrics
	â€¢	Pie and donut charts for categorical distributions
	â€¢	Bar charts for salary and satisfaction analysis
	â€¢	Filters for department, gender, and position
	â€¢	Applied consistent color themes for better readability.
	5.	Insight Generation
	â€¢	Analyzed trends in salary distribution, satisfaction levels, and attrition.
  â€¢	Identified areas needing attention (e.g., positions with high turnover or salary disparity).
	6.	Deployment
	â€¢	Saved the Power BI report as .pbix.
	â€¢	Exported a screenshot for presentation.
	â€¢	Uploaded the project files to GitHub for portfolio/demoÂ purposes.
